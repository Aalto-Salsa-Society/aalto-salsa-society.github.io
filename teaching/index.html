      <h2 class="text-center">TEACHER ROLE</h2>
      <h3 class="text-center">Teacher Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        ASS teachers play a crucial role in fostering joy and motivation to
        dance, develop students skills and maintain a positive and inclusive
        learning environment. While the teachers role includes teaching proper
        style and technique, they must keep in mind that ASS is a student
        organization with the main purpose in movement and enjoyment.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Lesson planning:</b> Prepare lessons with your teaching partner
          that align with our curriculum
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Classes:</b> Lead dance classes at least once a week. Show up early
          and if necessary reserve the room in AYY Tila. Take attendance of
          students.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Communication:</b> Communicate with your students about class
          location, absences and any other issues. Refer them to someone else if
          necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Attitude:</b> As a teacher you are the first point of contact for
          new students. Be polite and respectful and keep in mind that you are
          representing ASS.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Safety and support:</b> Ensure everyone in the class feels safe and
          comfortable. Mention correct hand placement while dancing. Be a
          contact person for complaints or worries and contact HCP if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Student feedback:</b> Provide clear and constructive feedback to
          students. Make sure to treat everyone fairly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Teacher training:</b> Aim to attend each teacher training if
          possible. Teacher training is meant for us to improve and revise our
          teaching, brainstorm teaching techniques and learn from each other's
          experiences. Teacher training helps all teachers be aligned with their
          teaching.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Teacher meetings:</b> Attend monthly teacher meetings to review the
          monthâ€™s classes and discuss any changes to the curriculum or schedule.
          Be proactive and share your thoughts with the Head of Teaching and the
          Teacher Coordinator.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Telegram group:</b> Be attentive to messages in the telegram
          teacher group, respond to polls and urgent matters.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-center">Becoming a Teacher</h3>
      <p>
        ASS welcomes new teachers who have prior dance experience and are
        willing to commit weekly to the association activities. When in need of
        new teachers, the teacher group will employ the regular procedure of
        recruitment.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Interested applicants are to fill out the Teacher Application Form
          provided to them by a teacher.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the next teacher meeting, new teacher applications are reviewed and
          discussed. Should the candidate be deemed suitable, they will be
          invited to attend teacher training sessions.
        </li>
        <li>
          The candidate must attend at least 3 training sessions. During these
          sessions, the candidate learns about leading a classroom, teaching
          technique, common mistakes of students, calling in rueda and proper
          student communication.
        </li>
        <li>The teacher training sessions are not dance classes.</li>
        <li>
          The candidate teaches a practice class in the teaching training
          session and if the teachers present approve (at least 3), the
          candidate can be proposed to the board.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once approved by the board, they are expected to follow the Teacher
          Responsibilities mentioned above.
